                    Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that employs pose tracking and 3D near-eye displays to give the user an immersive feel of a virtual world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment (particularly video games), education (such as medical or military training) and business (such as virtual meetings). Other distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality, sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR, although definitions are currently changing due to the nascence of the industry.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Currently, standard virtual reality systems use either virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments to generate some realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates auditory and video feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through haptic technology.

                        The Samsung Gear VR is a virtual reality headset developed by Samsung Electronics, in collaboration with Oculus VR, and manufactured by Samsung. The headset was released on August 21, 2015.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When in use, a compatible Samsung Galaxy device acts as the headset's display and processor, while the Gear VR unit itself acts as the controller, which contains the field of view, as well as a custom inertial measurement unit, or IMU, for rotational tracking, which connects to the smartphone via USB-C or micro-USB. The Gear VR headset also includes a touchpad and back button on the side, as well as a proximity sensor to detect when the headset is on.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The Gear VR was first announced on September 3, 2014. To allow developers to create content for the Gear VR and to allow VR and technology enthusiasts to get early access to the technology, Samsung had released two innovator editions of the Gear VR before the consumer version.

                        Samsung Gear VR can adjust focus using the scroll wheel on the top of the glasses. The touchpad is on the right side of the device, with the home and back buttons just above it. Volume can also be adjusted via the volume rocker on the right. The USB-C port is located on the bottom of the glasses.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Some of the main goals Samsung set for the project regarding the hardware were that their glasses could support MTP (Motion Photons) latency of less than 20 milliseconds as well as optimizing the hardware and cores, in addition to creating a QHD display for the Galaxy Note 4 that would work in the glasses Achieve high-definition rendering. The first three models have a lens field of view of 96°, while the R323 has a field of view of 101°.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Oculus Home is the primary facility for downloading and using content on Samsung Gear VR and is the main line for Gear VR software distribution. The main appeal of Gear VR is for mobile virtual reality-based games and simulations, and there has been growing interest recently in using the device in scientific and medical education.

                        PlayStation VR (codenamed Project Morpheus during development and officially abbreviated to PS VR) is a virtual reality headset developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment exclusively for the PlayStation 4, offering access to exclusive games not available on any other virtual reality glasses. PlayStation VR is a product of the PlayStation brand.

                        It was announced at the 2014 Game Developers Conference. Sony announced at the 2016 Game Developers Conference that PlayStation VR will be released in October 2016.

                        PlayStation VR connects to the PlayStation 4 via a separate hardware box (processing unit), which is responsible for the actual graphics processing and outputting the image to a TV or monitor via an HDMI cable. This is especially necessary if the headset wearer wants to play with others who don’t have VR equipment. This additional connection box is the only way to ensure that PlayStation VR users and game controller users experience the highest possible gaming quality. The headphones connect to the hardware box via another cable. There is also a remote attached to the cable for turning the headphones on and off, and the headphones for the audio signal are also connected to it. The headset itself has nine LEDs, which are used by the PlayStation camera connected to the console to detect the player's head movement.

                        <br />
                        PlayStation VR has a lower resolution compared to PC-based VR glasses like the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. It only offers 960 × 1080 pixels per eye, while its two PC counterparts offer 1080 × 1200 pixels per eye. However, according to Sony, the lower resolution should be hard to notice thanks to better display technology and a 120 Hz refresh rate.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The local multiplayer feature allows two players to play against each other - one on the TV and the other on PlayStation VR. For example, in Monster Escape, VR players can hunt other players as monsters. A maximum of one PlayStation VR can be connected to each Playstation, which is why the number of players is limited to 5 in this case.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Currently, Sony has provided more than a dozen VR-compatible games for PlayStation VR. In total, more than 60 VR games are already available. However, older games and movies are also available in the so-called movie mode, where the content is displayed on a virtual screen, so to speak. For better control, you can use the PlayStation 3's familiar Move controllers, as well as the AIM controllers designed specifically for PS VR.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In late 2017, an improved version of PlayStation VR was released in the United States and Japan, with minor modifications to the headset and processing unit. In addition to the minor cosmetic changes, a previously missing HDR pass-through option has been implemented, which allows HDR content to be looped directly through the processing unit to the TV. Previously, HDR-capable TVs had to replug the cables and connect them directly to the TV every time they wanted to play content on the PlayStation 4.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In early 2018, a revised version was also released in Europe. Meanwhile, Sony has also announced new bundles that now include a PlayStation Camera, stereo headphones, and one or more games, depending on the variant.
