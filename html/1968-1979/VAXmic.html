                <p>
                    The Virtual Address eXtension is a branch of computers that stand out from others at their time since it became the first 32-bit ISA 
                    architecture and virtual memory computer. This machine was developed in 1977 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation">DEC</a> (Digital Equipment Corporation), 
                    and is known to possibly be the most successful microcomputer in history. This microcomputer was designed to succeed the 16-bit PDP-11,
                    which is also known as one of the most successful microcomputers. The VAX Mic. Offered backward compatibility with its predecessor (PDP-11), 
                    and at the same time, extending memory into a 32-bit implementation, meaning that programs that where written on the PDP-11 could now access 
                    twice the memory capacity they used to have and still be compatible on both devices.

                        He was responsible on the design and development of the VAX microcomputer architecture. 
                        Although the architecture of the VAX microcomputer is one of his greatest achievements,

                <h2 class="sub_title">The VAX microcomputer architecture</h2>
                <p>
                    The VAX machine was a 32 bit CISC microcomputer.
                    Its instruction set was designed to be powerful and able to use all addressing modes (orthogonal). 
                    Most used programs at the time were written in assembly language, therefore the instruction set in the VAX 
                    machine had to be friendly in order for programmers to work with it.<br> <br>However with the pass of time,
                    more high level language programs were being developed, and therefore this machine became particularly used by 
                    compiler writers. <br><br>One particularity of the VAX microcomputer was that it contained a particular feature that 
                    was known as register masks. In essence, these are specific patterns of bits placed at the beginning if each 
                    subprogram, and when the control is transferred to a particular subprogram, the register masks designate which 
                    registers need to be saved of preserved.<br> <br>However the downside of this feature is that this arbitrary bit 
                    patterns become part of the actual machine code, therefore makes the process of optimising the machine code 
                    more complex and harder to analyse.

                        <p>
                            The VAX-11 played a significant role on shaping computer environments due to its versatile instruction set,
                            which allowed to handle a lot of computer tasks. 
                            <br><br>Another key feature is that it featured Virtual memory support, which was indeed a crucial characteristic
                            since it allowed a more efficient memory management.
                            <br> <br> And finally its compatibility with previous VAX devices allowed programmers run the same program on a 
                            newer version without making a big and important amount of modifications.

                    <p>
                        The VAX machine was indeed a revolutionary machine that changed the course of history of informatics, however, 
                        history has shown that every invention can and will be superseded by a new development. 
                        In this case, the development of the RISC technology challenged the mighty VAX microcomputer,
                        presenting a simpler and smaller set of instructions, which was more appeasable to programers. 
                        DEC decided they needed to catch up and later on developed machines that ran on a RISC architecture.
                        <br> In the year 2000, Compaq made public that the remaining VAX models were going to be discontinued,
                        and by 2005, manufacturing of this machines finally finally ceased.
