                <h2 class="sub_title">Home Computers of 1977</h2>
                <p>
                    Home computers were a very popular class of microcomputers that became 
                    merchandised in 1977, and became popular during the 1980’s. 
                    Their main characteristic and the reason for why they became so popular 
                    was that they entered the market as a costumer affordable product, 
                    which wasn’t common back in the days when computers were generally used
                    for military and academic purposes. 
                    This computers aimed to be “user friendly”, 
                    since they were designed for the personal use of a user that doesn’t
                    have diverse knowledge about using other complicated machines.
                    Its easier functionality and relative low cost in comparison to more 
                    complex machines that were mainly intended to be used for business,
                    science, engineering, and military research, home computers were indeed
                    way less powerful when it comes to memory and capability of adapting to
                    new upgrades and functions. 
                    However, home computers often had better graphic and sound qualities, 
                    which were more relevant to serve the purpose of a home computer.

                        As in many other aspects of technological development,
                        there are various companies that compete to place their product at the top of the market 
                        to succeed and grow as a company to become more costumer reliable and popular amongst the 
                        community. That is why in 1977, three very important and successful microcomputers were 
                        released, each containing different features that distinguished each from the other.
                        The development of these 3 home computers influenced the course of the growth and 
                        popularity of personal computers by establishing the bases of the development of personal
                        computers and allowing future projects and developers to reference both the successful 
                        aspects of each computer and the possible improvements to be made.

                    <p>
                        The Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) 2001-8-BS personal computer was a microcomputer 
                        developed in the United States by technological industry <a href="https://commodore.inc">Commodore.</a> 
                        This PC is known as one of the first and most successful home computers.
                        This computer featured a built in cassette in front of the computers case that was
                        functional for data storage. Placed in the market for $495,
                        featuring a 1 MHz MOS 6502 processor and 8 kilobytes + Additional space for RAM, 
                        this microcomputer became very popular for education purposes.

                    <p>
                        The Apple II home computer is an improved version of its predecessor, the Apple I, developed one year earlier by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. 
                        In April, 1977, this new microcomputer was introduced to the public and became an immediate success by placing <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a> as one of the most successful
                        and recognised computer brands. Similar to the Commodore PET, the Apple II PC also worker with a MOS 6502 processor, but only had 4 kilobytes of RAM.
                        However what made it stand out amongst other home computers developed in the moment, was that a short period of time after its release, 
                        Apple included a revolutionary feature to the Apple II PC. 
                        Instead of using a cassette for external storage it implemented an external floppy disk drive.
                        Also, the 8 expansion slots on the motherboard of the computer made it popular amongst programmers and computer enthusiast, 
                        by allowing them to plug different cards made by Apple.

                    The TRS-80 (Tandy Radio Shack), was released on August 1977, and came to be known as the mos successful microcomputer developed in 1977. 
                    This PC developed by the <a href="https://www.tandyonline.com">Tandy Radio-Shack</a> coorporation included a Zilog Z80 processor and 4 kilobytes of RAM, which at plain sight doesn’t 
                    explain its success, but clearly sets a differentiation point between its previous competitors. 
                    However the reason of its success comes with the amazing amount of features and functions the home computer included. 
                    This PC included a 12 inch monitor, a cassette recorder, and the king feature that led to its success, 
                    it included a cassette tape that ran Blackjack and Backgammon. This computer also included a power supply, making it longer lasting. 
                    Besides these new features led to the success of the TRS-80, it also include similar features to the Commodore PET and the Apple II, 
                    such as a BASIC interpreter and coloured graphics.
