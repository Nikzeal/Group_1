                Windows 1.0 stands as Microsoft's inaugural major release within the Windows family of graphical operating systems for personal computers. Initially launched in the US on November 20, 1985, its European counterpart, Windows 1.02, followed in May 1986.

  Inspired by the demonstration of a comparable software suite, Visi On, at COMDEX in 1982, Windows 1.0's development commenced. Although showcased publicly in November 1983, its official release was delayed by two years. Operating on MS-DOS as a 16-bit shell program named MS-DOS Executive, it allowed the execution of both graphical Windows programs and existing MS-DOS software. Featuring multitasking, mouse support, and bundled applications like Calculator, Paint, and Notepad, its non-overlapping windows were displayed in a tiled manner. Windows 1.0 witnessed four releases incorporating minor system updates.

  Reception for the system was mixed, criticized for falling short of expectations, limited software compatibility, and performance issues. Despite this, Microsoft garnered positive feedback for early presentations and secured support from various hardware and software manufacturers. Windows 1.0's final iteration was 1.04, paving the way for Windows 2.0's release in December 1987.

              Microsoft began envisioning the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) as early as 1981. The idea for Windows emerged after Bill Gates saw VisiCorp's Visi On, a GUI software suite for IBM PC computers, at COMDEX 1982. However, upon learning about Apple's more advanced GUI software, inspired by Xerox PARC's research, Microsoft sought to differentiate its offering. In August 1983, Gates recruited Scott A. McGregor, a key developer from PARC, to lead the Windows 1.0 development team.

            The initial demonstration of Windows to the press in September 1983 showcased a user interface resembling existing Microsoft applications with a command bar at the screen's bottom. It displayed multiple application windows in both overlapping and tiled arrangements. This early interface concept evolved to support only tiled windows with a menu bar under each window's title bar.



The redesigned version debuted publicly at Fall COMDEX 1983. Initially requiring 192 KB of RAM and two floppy disk drives, Windows was described as a device driver for MS-DOS 2.0. It supported cooperative multitasking for well-behaved applications and permitted non-well-behaved applications to run in a full screen, distinguishing itself from other offerings.</p>

             Microsoft aimed to encourage application development for Windows by not mandating a Microsoft user interface. Several computer and software companies pledged support for Windows, recognizing its potential impact on the desktop computing experience. Gates envisioned Windows as Microsoft's future, expressing a commitment similar to that of operating-system kernels like MS-DOS. The company anticipated Windows as the foundation for competitive applications in the long term. Despite Microsoft's efforts, IBM chose to develop its own product, TopView, rather than adopting Windows.

          <div class="mid_text">
<p class="text">
  This decision led to a reported "War of the Windows" involving Windows, IBM's TopView, and Digital Research's Graphics Environment Manager (GEM) by late 1984. Originally slated for an April 1984 release, Windows faced delays due to design modifications. Initially known by the codename "Interface Manager," Windows aimed to create a graphics-rich environment while using fewer system resources compared to its competitors.After Microsoft convinced IBM of the necessity for a GUI, both companies announced OS/2 and its graphical OS/2 Presentation Manager in April 1987, intending to eventually replace both MS-DOS and Windows.

It superseded both version 1.01 in the US and version 1.02 in Europe.</ul>

Later, on May 27, 1987, IBM released an OEM version that added VGA support, PS/2 mouse support, MCGA support, and compatibility with the 8514/A display driver. This version was distributed on three 3.5-inch 720k floppies and offered as part of bundles like the "Personal Publishing System" and "Collegiate Kit" by IBM.</ul>

    Windows 1.0 was developed using the MS-DOS kernel and functioned as a 16-bit shell program recognized as the MS-DOS Executive. It provided limited multitasking capabilities for existing MS-DOS applications and primarily focused on establishing interaction patterns, an execution model, and a reliable API for forthcoming native programs.

    The operating environment of Windows 1.0 supported mouse usage, enabling users to perform click-and-drag operations. Notably, in contrast to modern Windows systems, users had to keep the mouse button pressed to display the selected menu.
    Windows 1.0 featured the MS-DOS Executive, which would open an application window when .exe files were launched. Among its included programs were Calculator, Paint (known as Paintbrush back then), Notepad, Write, Terminal, and Clock. Notably, Paint only supported monochrome graphics.
    Additionally, the operating environment encompassed functionalities such as the Cardfile manager, Clipboard, and a Print Spooler program. Initially planned as playable video games, Puzzle and Chess were eventually scrapped, and Reversi was introduced as a commercially published video game included in Windows 1.0. Reversi relied on mouse control and was integrated as a built-in application.

<p class="text">
  Windows 1.0 also introduced the Control Panel, utilized for configuring the operating system's features. The environment did not permit overlapping windows; instead, windows were tiled. When a program was minimized, its icon appeared on a horizontal line at the screen's bottom, resembling the modern Windows taskbar.
  Windows 1.0 comprised three dynamic-link libraries named KERNEL.EXE, USER.EXE, and GDI.EXE, situated as files within the system. The Windows 1.0 SDK included debugging versions of these files, facilitating their replacement on the setup disks. The setup program merged multiple system files into a single unit to enable faster booting of Windows. By utilizing the debugging KERNEL.EXE from the Windows 1.0 SDK, one could create a "slow boot" version of Windows with separate files.

  Within Windows 1.0, a kernel executed crucial functions like task handling, memory management, and file input/output. The remaining two dynamic-link libraries encompassed the user interface and Graphics Device Interface (GDI). The operating environment allowed relocation of program code and data segments in memory, enabling programs to share code and data situated within dynamic-link libraries. Additionally, Windows 1.0 implemented code segment swapping as part of its functionality. </p>

<p class="text">
  Version 1.02 of Windows 1.0 introduced drivers tailored for European keyboards, alongside screen and print drivers. The final release, version 1.04, added support specifically for IBM PS/2 computers.

  Thanks to Microsoft's robust backward compatibility support, not only can Windows 1.0 binary programs be executed on current Windows versions to a significant extent, but their source code can also be recompiled into a comparably functional "modern" application with minimal adjustments.

  In March 2022, it was uncovered that the operating environment of Windows 1.0 contains an easter egg, showcasing a list of developers who contributed to its development, accompanied by a congratulatory message. </p>
