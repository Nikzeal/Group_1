                    The introduction of the first IBM PC in 1981 marked a significant milestone in the evolution of
                    personal computing. Before this groundbreaking development, non-IBM personal computers had existed
                    since the mid-1970s, albeit with limited applications that did not justify widespread use. However,
                    IBM's foray into personal computing began with the announcement of the IBM 5100 Portable Computer in
                    1975, drawing on the innovative SCAMP prototype of 1973.
                    <br>
                    IBM's venture into personal computing began with the announcement of the IBM 5100 Portable Computer
                    in September 1975. Drawing on the pioneering SCAMP (Special Computer, APL Machine Portable)
                    prototype of 1973, this desktop computer, weighing approximately 50 pounds, combined the storage
                    capacity and performance of the IBM 1130 with the compact size and user-friendly interface akin to
                    an IBM Selectric Typewriter. Subsequent models like the IBM 5110 and 5120 followed, establishing
                    IBM's presence in the small computer market.

                    The pivotal moment, however, came with the unveiling of IBM's own Personal Computer, the IBM 5150,
                    in August 1981. The decision to pursue personal computing was not without its challenges, with early
                    studies suggesting a lack of applications justifying broad acceptance. Undeterred, Bill Lowe, the
                    lab director in Boca Raton, Florida, set up a task force that, within a year, developed the proposal
                    for the first IBM PC. The team, breaking away from traditional IBM practices, embraced an open
                    architecture, collaborating with external vendors and software developers, and acting as an
                    independent business unit.
                    <br>
                    The development team, led by Don Estridge, adopted a meticulous approach. They adhered to a
                    well-conceived plan covering hardware, software, manufacturing setup, and sales strategy. Despite
                    skepticism and conventional wisdom that "IBM bringing out a personal computer would be like teaching
                    an elephant to tap dance," the team succeeded in presenting a prototype to Microsoft by the end of
                    1980.

                    The manufacturing process of the first IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in the early 1980s was
                    characterized by a strategic and efficient approach to meet the ambitious goal of developing and
                    announcing the PC within a remarkably short timeframe of 12 months. Here are some key aspects of the
                    manufacturing process:

            <!--Example of div with list-->
            <div class="under_text">
                <div class="list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>The manufacturing strategy adopted for the IBM PC aimed for <b>Simplicity</b>. The team
                            recognized
                            the time constraints and complexity associated with developing and testing all components
                            individually. To address this, they opted for a simplified approach that involved sourcing
                            completely functioning and pretested subassemblies.</li>
                        <li>Leveraging tested <b>Vendor Technology</b> was a crucial aspect of the manufacturing
                            strategy.
                            Instead of developing and testing every component in-house, the team sourced components from
                            external vendors that were known for their reliability. This decision allowed for faster
                            assembly and reduced the risk of defects.</li>
                        <li>The team opted for a <b>Standardized</b> approach by creating a <b>One-Model Product</b>.
                            This decision
                            streamlined the manufacturing process as it eliminated the need for extensive customization
                            and variation in the assembly line. Standardization also contributed to consistent product
                            quality.</li>
                        <li>The manufacturing team was committed to achieving <b>Zero Defects</b>. This quality control
                            measure
                            was a fundamental part of the plan, emphasizing the importance of delivering a reliable and
                            high-quality product. Rigorous testing procedures were implemented to ensure that each unit
                            met the established quality standards.</li>
                        <li>To meet the tight deadlines, the manufacturing process focused on <b>Efficiency</b>. Once
                            the
                            subassemblies were sourced, the assembly process was carried out with precision and speed.
                            Testing procedures were integrated into the assembly line to identify and rectify any
                            defects promptly.</li>
                        <li>The manufacturing team took over from the development team in April 1981 when the engineers
                            had virtually finished the machine. This transition allowed for a seamless continuation of
                            the project, ensuring that the manufacturing process could keep up with the rapid pace set
                            by the development team.</li>
                        <li>The efficiency in manufacturing played a crucial role in meeting the <b>Overwhelming
                                Consumer
                                Demand</b> following the announcement of the IBM PC. Dealers experienced high demand,
                            and the
                            manufacturing process had to scale up to produce units at a rate of one system per minute
                            during business hours by the end of 1982.</li>

                    On August 12, 1981, at the Waldorf Astoria ballroom in New York City, Don Estridge announced the IBM
                    Personal Computer, priced at $1,565. This system unit, powered by an Intel 8088 microprocessor,
                    offered advanced features like a numeric keypad and 10 special keys for text processing. Options
                    included printers, color/graphics monitors, and expandable memory cards.
                    <br>
                    IBM strategically partnered with retailers like ComputerLand, Sears, Roebuck and Co., and IBM
                    Product Centers to ensure widespread availability. The response was overwhelming, with dealers
                    experiencing high demand and sales reaching an astonishing rate of one system per minute during
                    business hours by the end of 1982. Newsweek labeled it "IBM's roaring success," and the New York
                    Times acknowledged the speed and extent of its impact.
