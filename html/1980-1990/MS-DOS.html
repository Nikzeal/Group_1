                    MS-DOS, an acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System, is an operating system primarily developed
                    by Microsoft for x86-based personal computers. It was a key component of IBM PC compatibles in the
                    1980s before being gradually replaced by graphical user interface (GUI) operating systems, such as
                    Microsoft Windows.
                    <br>
                    Initially released in 1981 and rebranded by IBM as PC DOS 1.0, MS-DOS and PC DOS were developed in
                    parallel by Microsoft and IBM. However, after twelve years, in 1993, the two products diverged with
                    notable differences in compatibility, syntax, and capabilities.
                    <br>
                    Competing products like DR-DOS emerged in 1988, offering alternatives for the x86 platform. MS-DOS
                    underwent eight versions, with development concluding in 2000. Originally designed for Intel 8086
                    processors and floppy disk storage, it evolved to support various mass storage media, larger
                    formats, and newer processors, reflecting the dynamic changes in computer hardware.
                    <br>
                    MS-DOS played a crucial role in Microsoft's transformation from a programming language company to a
                    diverse software development firm, providing essential revenue and marketing resources. It served as
                    the underlying operating system for early versions of Windows, running as a graphical user interface
                    (GUI). The legacy of MS-DOS is integral to the history of personal computing and Microsoft's
                    evolution as a technology giant.

                <p class="text">
                    MS-DOS, originated from 86-DOS, developed by Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products. Created in
                    just six weeks, 86-DOS was a clone of Digital
                    Research's CP/M, adapted for 8086 processors and featuring improvements like enhanced disk sector
                    buffering and the introduction of FAT12 instead of CP/M's file system. Microsoft acquired 86-DOS for
                    $75,000 in 1981, renaming it MS-DOS, and simultaneously licensed it to IBM as PC DOS 1.0 for the IBM
                    5150.
                    <br>
                    Initially designed to run on any 8086-family computer, MS-DOS embraced a modular structure, allowing
                    OEMs to create distinct versions for their hardware. This approach aimed for compatibility similar
                    to CP/M but introduced challenges as developers favored direct hardware control, especially for
                    games. The industry eventually moved toward IBM-compatible architectures, resulting in a
                    standardized version of MS-DOS for the broader market.
                    <br>
                    Microsoft excluded multi-user support from MS-DOS since its Unix-based system, Xenix, fulfilled that
                    role. The company initially planned to evolve MS-DOS into a single-user Xenix with cross-platform
                    compatibility but eventually abandoned Xenix in favor of AT&T's Unix System V. In 1987, Microsoft
                    transferred ownership of Xenix to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO).
                    <br>
                    On March 25, 2014, Microsoft released the code for SCP MS-DOS 1.25, Altos MS-DOS 2.11, and TeleVideo
                    PC DOS 2.11 under the Microsoft Research License Agreement. Later, on September 28, 2018, Microsoft
                    re-licensed the code under the MIT License, making these versions freely available.
                    <br>
                    As an April Fool's Day prank in 2015, Microsoft Mobile introduced MS-DOS Mobile, a Windows Phone
                    application mimicking the appearance and functionality of MS-DOS, offering a playful nod to the
                    operating system's history.

                    Although most computer users prefer a modern OS with a graphical user interface (GUI), there are
                    still reasons to use MS-DOS. Some of these include the following:
                </p>
            </div>

            <!--Example of div with list-->
            <div class="under_text">

                    <ul>
                        <li>Education and research efforts let people learn about how a simple OS works. Source code is
                            available from Microsoft for two MS-DOS versions; emulators and OSes providing MS-DOS
                            functionality also enable learning about the OS.</li>
                        <li>Legacy systems persist throughout the world. In some cases, organizations prefer to continue
                            using a system that has worked reliably for decades. In others, there is no budget for
                            upgrading the applications.</li>
                        <li>Embedded systems depend on MS-DOS, especially for new devices that still use x86 processor
                            architecture. MS-DOS is also used on legacy embedded devices, some of which have been in the
                            field for decades. In some case, these embedded systems can be updated to run up-to-date
                            versions of compatible OSes.</li>
                        <li>Classic older computer games are still in use that were developed and supported only on
                            MS-DOS.</li>
                        <li>User inertia or the preference to skip all updates drives some people and organizations to
                            continue using MS-DOS. For example, author George R.R. Martin famously admitted in 2014 to
                            still using WordStar 4.0, which was released in 1987, on a computer running MS-DOS.</li>

                    MS-DOS operates through command-line input and output, where users issue commands and receive
                    system results. Upon booting, MS-DOS systems present a command prompt, and users enter commands
                    via a keyboard.
                    <br>
                    Commands in MS-DOS can be standard DOS commands integrated into the operating system or the file
                    name of an executable program. Despite lacking native GUI support, MS-DOS can execute graphical
                    programs if installed on a system disk or diskette. Users initiate these programs through
                    commands, allowing the program to control input and output devices. Once the graphical program
                    concludes, control returns to MS-DOS, and the command prompt becomes visible again.
                    <br>
                    There are currently at least four ways to use MS-DOS:

                    PC-compatible computers. These included the following:

                    <ul>
                        <li>DR-DOS for IBM PC-compatible computers. Digital Research originally developed DR-DOS to
                            compete with MS-DOS and PC-DOS. DR-DOS was ultimately rebranded as Novell DOS and Caldera
                            OpenDOS. None of these OSes are currently being distributed or supported.</li>
                        <li>FreeDOS is an open source version of MS-DOS that is still actively being developed,
                            supported and used.</li>
                        <li>PTS-DOS is an MS-DOS clone developed in Russia and still actively published.</li>
                        <li>ROM-DOS is used in embedded systems. First released in 1989, it is compatible with MS-DOS.
                            Finland-based embedded system software vendor Tuxera still sells it today.</li>

                    A PC emulator -- a program that emulates an Intel x86-based PC -- enables an MS-DOS clone or
                    compatible OS to run on a modern computer. An example of this is when FreeDOS is used on a virtual
                    machine that emulates a PC.
                    <br>
                    More accessible emulators run on modern OSes and provide the MS-DOS experience in a window. Active
                    DOS emulation projects include:

                        <li>The DOSBox project publishes MS-DOS emulation software for running DOS-based games on
                            Windows, macOS and several popular Linux distributions under the Gnu General Public License.

                        <li>Another option is to use an online MS-DOS emulator. James Friend, a developer with interest
                            in classic personal computing, hosts an online PC-DOS emulator. Alternatively, MS-DOS or
                            compatible OSes can be installed on PC emulators. For example, hobbyist Hampa Hug publishes
                            an emulator for the IBM PC model 5150 to reproduce the experience of working with a classic
                            IBM PC.</li>

                    One can also experiment with the original MS-DOS code base, released in 2018. The Github repository
                    includes original source code and binaries for MS-DOS versions 1.25 and 2.0. As noted on the
                    repository homepage, Microsoft published the code "to allow exploration and experimentation for
                    those interested in early PC operating systems."

                    MS-DOS commands, entered at the command prompt, are intrinsic functions within the operating system,
                    numbering around 100 depending on the version. In addition to these default commands, other
                    executable programs can be entered at the command line in a similar manner.
                    <br><br>
                    Two main types of executable programs include:
                    <br><br>
                    1.Batch files:These are text files containing sequences of MS-DOS commands, employing
                    programming constructs like loops and GOTO statements. Batch files can encompass both MS-DOS
                    commands and application programs.
                    <br><br>
                    2.Application programs:These are binary executable files compiled from source code.

                    During the early days of personal computing, proficiency at the command line was a crucial skill for
                    users. Many primarily interacted with applications such as spreadsheets, word processors, and file
                    managers, relying on the command line for effective system operation.
                    <br><br>
                    Common MS-DOS commands include the following:
