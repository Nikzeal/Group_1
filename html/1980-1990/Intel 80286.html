                    <b>The Intel 80286</b> (also marketed as the iAPX 286 and often called Intel 286) is a 16-bit
                    microprocessor that was introduced on February 1, 1982. It was the first 8086-based CPU with
                    separate, non-multiplexed address and data buses and also the first with memory management and wide
                    protection abilities. The 80286 used approximately 134,000 transistors in its original nMOS (HMOS)
                    incarnation and, just like the contemporary 80186, it could correctly execute most software
                    written for the earlier Intel 8086 and 8088 processors.
                    <br>
                    The 80286 was employed for the IBM PC/AT, introduced in 1984, and then widely used in most PC/AT
                    compatible computers until the early 1990s. In 1987, Intel shipped its five-millionth 80286
                    microprocessor.

            <div class="text_container">
                <p class="text">
                    Intel's first 80286 chips were specified for a maximum clockrate of 5, 6 or 8 MHz and later releases
                    for 12.5 MHz. AMD and Harris later produced 16 MHz, 20 MHz and 25 MHz parts, respectively. Intel,
                    Intersil and Fujitsu also designed fully static CMOS versions of Intel's original depletion-load
                    nMOS implementation, largely aimed at battery-powered devices. Intel's CMOS version of the 80286 was
                    the 80C286.
                    <br>
                    On average, the 80286 was reportedly measured to have a speed of about 0.21 instructions per clock
                    on "typical" programs, although it could be significantly faster on optimized code and in tight
                    loops, as many instructions could execute in 2 clock cycles each. The 6 MHz, 10 MHz, and 12 MHz
                    models were reportedly measured to operate at 0.9 MIPS, 1.5 MIPS, and 2.66 MIPS respectively.
                    <br>
                    The later E-stepping level of the 80286 was free of the several significant errata that caused
                    problems for programmers and operating-system writers in the earlier B-step and C-step CPUs (common
                    in the AT and AT clones). This E-2 stepping part may have been available in later 1986.
                    <br>
                    Intel second sourced this microprocessor to Fujitsu Limited around 1985.

                <p class="text">
                    Intel did not anticipate personal computers using the 286, as it was designed for multi-user systems
                    with multitasking applications, communications, and real-time process control. The 80286 had 134,000
                    transistors and comprised four independent units: the address unit, bus unit, instruction unit, and
                    execution unit, organized into a loosely coupled (buffered) pipeline, similar to the 8086. It was
                    produced in a 68-pin package, including PLCC, LCC, and PGA packages.
                    <br>
                    The 80286's performance increase over the 8086 (or 8088) could exceed 100% per clock cycle in many
                    programs, representing a significant improvement comparable to later processors like the i486 or the
                    original Pentium. This was due to non-multiplexed address and data buses, less expensive address
                    calculations, and improved efficiency in instruction prefetch, buffering, jumps, and microcoded
                    numerical operations.
                    <br>
                    In addition to all 8086 instructions, the 80286 included new instructions from the 80186 and
                    introduced new instructions for protected mode. It had a 24-bit address bus, providing a 16 MB
                    physical address space and was the first x86 processor to support virtual memory, allowing up to 1
                    GB via segmentation. However, until late in its production, 80286 computers rarely shipped with more
                    than 1 MB of RAM due to memory cost and limited software support for memory above 1 MB.

                    Despite being the first x86 CPU to support protected mode, the 80286's protected mode was not widely
                    used in PC applications until many years after its release. This was due to the high cost of adding
                    extended memory to a PC and the need for software to support the large user base of 8086 PCs.
                    Additionally, the incompatibility of older real-mode DOS programs with protected mode made it
                    difficult for them to run natively without significant modification. Memory management and interrupt
                    handling were done differently in protected mode, and DOS programs would directly access data and
                    code segments that did not belong to them. While it was possible to set up a protected-mode
                    environment that allowed all programs access to all segments, this undermined nearly all of the
                    advantages of protected mode except the extended address space. Moreover, registers were still
                    16-bit, and the programmer was still forced to use a memory map composed of 64 kB segments, just
                    like in real mode. As a result, protected mode did not provide a significant enough performance
                    advantage over the 8086-compatible real mode to justify supporting its capabilities.
