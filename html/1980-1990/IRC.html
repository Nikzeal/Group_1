                <p class="text">
                    During the summer of 1988, Jarkko Oikarinen (born 16 August 1967, in Kuusamo, Finland), a 2nd-year
                    student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Oulu, Finland, was working
                    at the University Department of Information Processing Science, where he administered the
                    department’s Sun Unix server “tolsun.Oulu.fi”, running on a public access BBS (bulletin board
                    system) called OuluBox.

                    The work with server administration didn’t take all his time, so Jarkko started doing a
                    communication program, which was meant to make OuluBox a little more usable. Partly inspired by
                    Jyrki Kuoppala’s “rmsg” program for sending messages to people on other machines, and partly by
                    Bitnet Relay Chat, Oikarinen decided to improve the existing multi-user chat program on OuluBox
                    called MultiUser Talk (MUT) (which had a bad habit of not working correctly), itself based on the
                    basic talk program then available on Unix computers. He called the resulting program IRC (for
                    Internet Relay Chat) and first deployed it at the end of August 1988.

                    The Internet Relay Chat Protocol was defined in May, 1993, in RFC 1459 of Jarkko Oikarinen and
                    Darren Reed. It was mainly described as a protocol for group communication in discussion forums,
                    called channels. It also allows one-to-one communication via private message and chat and data
                    transfers via Direct Client-to-Client.

                    In the 1990s, IRC gained many users until 2003, when users started declining as new chat platforms
                    emerged. As of the end of 2009, the top 100 IRC networks served more than half a million users at a
                    time, with hundreds of thousands of channels, operating on a total of some 1,500 servers worldwide.

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Social Interaction:</b> IRC allows users to join chat rooms, called channels, where they
                            can discuss various topics and interests, make new friends, and interact with like-minded
                            individuals from around the world.</li>
                        <li><b>Technical Support:</b> Many software and technology communities use IRC channels to
                            provide real-time technical support and assistance. Users can ask questions, seek advice,
                            and get help with problems related to specific software or technology topics.</li>
                        <li><b>Collaboration:</b> Developers and teams can use IRC channels for project coordination,
                            brainstorming, and collaborative problem-solving. It provides an efficient way to
                            communicate and share ideas in real-time.</li>
                        <li><b>Information Sharing:</b> Users can share news, announcements, and updates on specific
                            subjects in IRC channels dedicated to those topics. This information can be disseminated
                            quickly and easily among interested parties.</li>

                    While IRC’s popularity has declined with the rise of newer communication platforms, it continues to
                    serve as a valuable resource for real-time text communication in various contexts.

                    IRC is an open protocol that uses TCP and, optionally, TLS. An IRC server can connect to other
                    IRC servers to expand the IRC network. Users access IRC networks by connecting a client to a
                    server. There are many client implementations, such as mIRC, HexChat and irssi, and server
                    implementations, e.g. the original IRCd. Most IRC servers do not require users to register an
                    account but a nickname is required before being connected.

                    IRC was originally a plain text protocol (although later extended), which on request was
                    assigned port 194/TCP by IANA. However, the de facto standard has always been to run IRC on
                    6667/TCP and nearby port numbers (for example TCP ports 6660–6669, 7000) to avoid having to
                    run the IRCd software with root privileges.

                    The protocol specified that characters were 8-bit but did not specify the character encoding the
                    text was supposed to use. This can cause problems when users using different clients and/or
                    different platforms want to converse.

                    IRC infrastructure has four essential components through which users interact: Servers, Networks,
                    Channels, and Clients. The network is a web of servers where users connect through
                    clients—text-based applications designed to user channel interactions.

                        <b>Here’s an overview of how IRC works:</b>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Client-Server Architecture:</b> Users connect to an IRC network using a client (software)
                            that communicates with IRC servers. Servers are responsible for managing channels and
                            relaying messages between clients.</li>
                        <li><b>Connection:</b> To join an IRC network, a user must run an IRC client on their device and
                            connect to an IRC server by providing the server’s address and port number. The client
                            establishes a TCP connection with the server to facilitate communication.</li>
                        <li><b>Connection Registration:</b> When a client connects to an IRC server, it must provide a
                            nickname (NICK) and user information (USER) to register its connection. The server may also
                            require a password (PASS) for authentication. Once the connection is registered, the user is
                            connected to the IRC network.</li>
                        <li><b>Channels:</b> IRC users communicate in virtual chat rooms called channels. Channels are
                            identified by a prefix, usually a hash symbol (#), followed by the channel name (e.g.,
                            #channel_name). Users can join channels using the JOIN command and leave channels with the
                            PART command.</li>
                        <li><b>Messaging:</b> Users can send messages within channels, which are then relayed by the
                            server to all connected clients in that channel. For private messages, users can use the
                            PRIVMSG command to send a message directly to another user.</li>
                        <li><b>User and Channel Modes:</b> Users and channels can have various modes that define their
                            status or behavior within the IRC network. Channel operators (also known as “ops”) can
                            modify channel modes to manage access, messaging, and other aspects of channel operation.
                            Users can also set their own modes to indicate their status, such as being away or
                            invisible.</li>
                        <li><b>Ping-Pong Mechanism:</b> To maintain active connections and detect inactive clients, IRC
                            servers and clients use the PING and PONG commands. A server periodically sends a PING
                            message to connected clients, which must reply with a PONG message to acknowledge their
                            presence.</li>
                        <li><b>Extensibility:</b> The IRC protocol is extensible, allowing developers to create new
                            commands, features, and services. These additions can enhance the user experience, provide
                            additional functionality, or improve network administration.</li>
                    </ul>

                    IRC works by facilitating real-time text-based communication between users through a client-server
                    architecture, allowing users to connect to channels, send messages, and interact with other users.
                    The protocol’s simplicity, extensibility, and real-time communication capabilities have made it a
                    popular choice for online chat and collaboration over the years.
