                            The ability to send money to anyone, anywhere in the world is one of the most important elements of our modern digitilized and globalized economy. But it wasn't always possible. We owe that ability to the great innovators in that field whose history we will explore in this article.

                            Banking was vital for human economy for centuries, taking on different forms in different times to accomodate the needs of society at that time and any technological advancements that were made towards the banking industry helped the entire economy.
                            The world was becoming more and more connected and thus it needed a way to easily transfer money between people and companies in different places fast. And then came the Internet - the perfect tool for that.

                            The first bank that tried to use the Internet to make its services better was the Bank of Scotland that launched the first electronic online banking system for its customers. The first website however was created by Stanford Federal Credit Union in 1994. They offered their customers the ability to check their account balances, transfer money and pay bills online.

                        <p class="description">
                            <br>
                            While the biggest traditional banks were adopting the technology they did not change the way they operated. The most influencial pioneers in the field of modern online banking were only starting to emerge in the late 90s. Those players are Confinity and X.com.
                            <br><br>
                            In 1999 Confinity launched PayPal - a service that allowed people to send money to each other via email. The service turned out to be a huge innovation and a great success.
                            <br><br>
                            That same year Elon Musk founded X.com a company that offered very similar services to PayPal.

                            It offered FDIC insured deposits without fees and without the need to mail a check - the whole registration process could be done online. The bank also offered a referral code that allowed users to get $20 for every person they referred to the bank. Almost every one of those features is a standard now but was unique at the time.

                            Few months later X.com and Confinity merged to form PayPal as we know it today. The company went public and was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion. Paypal was at the forefront of the online banking revolution as eBay subsidiary. Later on it was spun off as a separate company in 2015 and is now an ecommerce giant after aquiring many smaller companies.

                        <p class="description">
                            <br>
                            The spread of online banking has had a huge impact on the world. It decreased the costs of running a bank and thus allowed banks to offer better services for their bigger customer bases not limited by geography. In some ways it democratized quality banking because it allowed people to choose the best bank for them regardless of where they live with much lower fees than before.
                            <br><br>
                            It was also a huge life improvement for people in developing countries where the traditional banking system is not as developed and the circumstances are really hostile towards stable, secure and centralized banking. Online and mobile banking is said to "bank the unbanked" at an unprecedented rates in countries like Kenya.
                            <br><br>
                            And specifically the before-mentioned merger gave Elon Musk capital to invest into tesla and SpaceX possibly contributing towards innovations in those areas.
