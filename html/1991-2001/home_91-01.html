                            Between 1990 and 2000, there was a significant surge in technological developments and the introduction of 
                            various groundbreaking tech products. These technological improvements started with the widespread adoption 
                            of personal computers with Microsoft Windows as the most dominant operating system. In the aspect of hardware, 
                            Intel released several generations of microprocessors improving speed and efficiency. On the other hand, 
                            internet became accessible to the public, while mobile phones became smaller, more affordable and widely used.
                            In the aspect of entertainment, Sony Playstation and Nintendo 64 were introduced and E-commerce platforms, 
                            like Amazon and eBay, transformed the way people shopped.
                            These developments laid the foundation for the digital age, shaping the way people communicate, work,
                            and access information, and paved the way for further technological innovations in the 21st century.

                            a British computer scientist, developed the World Wide Web while working at CERN. 
                            The inaugural website provided information about the World Wide Web project, explaining how to create web pages and set up servers. 
                            It served as a foundational resource for understanding the concept of the web and included links to technical details. 
                            This groundbreaking development marked the beginning of the internet as we know it today, laying the groundwork for the 
                            interconnected digital landscape that has since transformed communication, information-sharing, and various aspects of modern life.

                            By the beginning of 1993, the World Wide Web consisted of data spread across approximately fifty servers. 
                            Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, played a pivotal role in its development. 
                            The web's early structure was decentralised, with information residing on servers globally. 
                            The primary purpose of this interconnected network was to facilitate the sharing and dissemination of information.
                            Users accessed data using early web browsers, navigating a landscape that laid the foundation for the expansive and interconnected internet we experience today.

                            The dot-com boom commenced in 1994 and 1995, characterized by a surge in internet-related investments and the establishment 
                            of numerous online businesses. 
                            The period saw the rise of pioneering companies like Netscape, which went public in 1995, 
                            and Amazon, which began as an online bookstore. Investors were captivated by the potential of the internet, 
                            leading to a frenzied atmosphere of speculation and substantial financial investments in dot-com ventures. 
                            This era witnessed the birth of many iconic internet companies, laying the groundwork for the digital transformation that would follow.

                            The first macro virus, Concept, was discovered in 1995. 
                            Unlike traditional viruses that infect executable files, Concept targeted the macro language in Microsoft Word.
                            Written by a Swiss coder, it spread by infecting Word documents, causing them to carry the virus to other documents. 
                            Concept highlighted the vulnerability of office productivity software to malicious code. 
                            Its discovery prompted increased awareness about the potential threats posed by macro viruses, 
                            leading to the development of antivirus measures and a greater emphasis on cybersecurity for users of word processing applications.
